### The bowerbird

Bower is named after the [bowerbird](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowerbird), a [family of birds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XkPeN3AWIE) where _males build a structure [the bower] and decorate it with sticks and brightly coloured objects in an attempt to attract a mate_. Bower does just that. Bower brings together bits and pieces from across the forest so you can build your structure.
